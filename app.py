    Scheduling problems involve allocating resources (e.g., time, personnel, machines) to tasks over a period to achieve an optimal outcome. When solved with Linear Programming, these problems are formulated mathematically, consisting of:

    * **Decision Variables**: Represent the choices (e.g., how many people to assign to a shift).
    * **Objective Function**: The goal to optimize (e.g., minimize cost, maximize profit).
    * **Constraints**: Limitations or rules that must be followed (e.g., minimum staff required, maximum working hours).

    By defining these components as linear expressions, LP solvers can find the best possible solution.

    Here are key areas where Linear Programming is applied to optimize scheduling:

    1.  **Staff/Workforce Scheduling**: Minimizing labor costs while meeting demand and adhering to labor laws, employee preferences, and skill requirements (e.g., nurse scheduling in hospitals, call center staffing, bus driver rosters).
    2.  **Production Planning and Scheduling**: Optimizing production runs to meet demand, minimize inventory costs, and efficiently utilize machinery and raw materials.
    3.  **Transportation and Logistics Scheduling**: Determining optimal routes and schedules for fleets of vehicles (e.g., delivery trucks, airlines) to minimize fuel consumption, travel time, or maximize deliveries.
    4.  **Resource Allocation**: Distributing limited resources (e.g., budget, equipment, raw materials) among competing projects or tasks to achieve specific objectives.
    5.  **Project Scheduling**: Optimizing the timeline and resource allocation for complex projects to meet deadlines and minimize costs.
    6.  **Energy Management Scheduling**: Planning the operation of power plants or energy consumption in industrial facilities to minimize costs or carbon emissions.
    7.  **Machine Scheduling**: Optimizing the sequence of jobs on machines to minimize completion time, maximize throughput, or reduce setup costs.
    8.  **Classroom/University Timetabling**: Creating optimal class schedules that accommodate student and instructor preferences, room availability, and minimize
